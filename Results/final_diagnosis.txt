### Final Diagnosis:

* **Anxiety Disorder**: The patient's history of anxiety, family history of generalized anxiety disorder, and current symptoms of intense chest pain, heart palpitations, and fear of having a heart attack may indicate an underlying anxiety disorder, such as panic disorder, as noted by the Psychologist and supported by the Cardiologist's report of anxiety-related symptoms.
* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) with respiratory complications**: The patient's GERD could be causing chest pain and discomfort, which may be exacerbated by stress and anxiety, as reported by the Cardiologist, and potentially triggering respiratory issues, such as shortness of breath and hyperventilation, as noted by the Pulmonologist.
* **Cardiac Arrhythmia with anxiety-related symptoms**: The Holter monitor results showed occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), which could be a sign of an underlying arrhythmia, as reported by the Cardiologist, and the patient's anxiety symptoms, such as palpitations and shortness of breath, may be contributing to or exacerbating the arrhythmia, as noted by the Psychologist and Pulmonologist.
